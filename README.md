<h3>😄 Who am I ?</h3>

Currently an intern at the Marie Thérèse Solacroup Institute, I am in professional training in web development and I want to focus on the Front-end.
Before this training, I was in high school to obtain my diploma in literature and arts.
Afterwards, I heard about a training that encompassed everything related to digital including web development so I decided to do it.
